**Notes::**
1. The optgroup tag is used to group related options in a dropdown list. This makes it easier to understand their choices when looking at a large list.
2. fieldset and legend Elements:
The **fieldset** element is used to provide grouping for a part of an HTML form. To
make the elements more presentable, the **fieldset** tag draws a box around the
related elements.
 There is a **legend** tag that comes just after the **fieldset** tag. To provide a title or
explanatory caption for the rest of the contents of the legend element's parent
element, this **legend** element is used.
<pre>
<form>
      <fieldset>
            <legend>
                  Subscribe:
            </legend>
            Name: <input
type="text"
name="name"
id="name">
      </fieldset>
</form>
</pre

3. The post method is used to send critical data. The data is automatically passed in header of the request send and is accessible to the server.
